I'm a master's degree candidate in robotics and autonomous systems from the University of Sussex under the supervision of Dr. Nicolas Herzig. I got a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University (211) and I will get my master's degree in January of next year and plan to further my study in the field of robotics.

You can find my CV here: [Xiangyu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV7.pdf).
